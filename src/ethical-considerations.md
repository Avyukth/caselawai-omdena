# Ethical Considerations

When developing a generative AI system for the legal domain, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications. The team will ensure that the summarization tool does not introduce biases, respects client confidentiality, and aligns with the legal profession's ethical standards. Appropriate safeguards and transparency measures will be implemented to maintain the trust and confidence of legal professionals.
