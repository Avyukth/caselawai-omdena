# Introduction

The legal industry is facing an ever-increasing volume of documents, contracts, and case law, making it challenging for lawyers and legal professionals to efficiently summarize and extract key information. Generative AI models present an opportunity to automate this process, enhancing the productivity and accuracy of legal document analysis. This research-level documentation outlines the development of a generative AI-powered legal document summarization system.

## Executive Summary

This project aims to revolutionize legal research and case law analysis, with a specific focus on employment discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We have developed an advanced AI-powered system that leverages a Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining the strengths of vector-based and graph-based methods to improve the accuracy and relevance of legal information retrieval and analysis.
