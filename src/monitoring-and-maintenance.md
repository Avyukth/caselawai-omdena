# Monitoring And Maintenance

#### The project team will implement robust monitoring and maintenance processes to ensure the ongoing reliability and performance of the deployed system. This will include:
- Continuous monitoring of summary quality and user feedback
- Periodic retraining and fine-tuning of the language model
- Proactive software updates and security patches
- Scalable infrastructure to handle increasing user demand

## Challenges and Future Work

- Scalability: Optimize for large-scale legal databases
- Fine-tuning: Improve balance between vector and graph components
- Explainability: Enhance reasoning capabilities
- Expansion: Adapt to broader range of legal domains
