# Data Preprocessing

#### The collected legal documents will undergo the following preprocessing steps:
- Text extraction from various file formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, etc.)
- Removal of sensitive or confidential information
- Normalization of text (e.g., handling abbreviations, legal jargon, and formatting)
- Segmentation of documents into logical sections (e.g., headings, paragraphs)
