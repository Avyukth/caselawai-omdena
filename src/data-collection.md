# Data Collection

#### The project team has identified the following data sources for training the generative AI model:
- Publicly available legal case law databases
- Curated legal document repositories from reputable law firms and legal organizations
- Anonymized contracts and agreements from the client's own database

## Methodology

The data was gathered using web scraping techniques and manual collection from public sites like the U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). I have compiled summaries of key employment laws and court judgments, which were integral to the project's purpose of providing legal professionals with the required data.
